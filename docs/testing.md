# Testing

# Unit Tests

Each module contains its own unit tests; the Continuous Integration system runs all of the tests before deploying the application.  You can also run them locally to verify.

Please use `@skip` if a local test is not platform agnostic.

# Functional Tests

These tests are implemented through test automation that is triggered in the release pipeline.  For an overview of these tests, please contact the team.
